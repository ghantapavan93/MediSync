# Dashboard Application

This project contains a simple demo of our main project's frontend. It uses a Node.js server with Express to serve 4 HTML pages and their respective CSS styles.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone <repository_url>
```
2. Install Dependencies
```
cd Demo
npm install
```

3. Run the Server
```
node server.js
```


### How to Access:

- Open your web browser.
- Go to `http://localhost:4000/` to view the main homepage.
- Go to `http://localhost:4000/admin` to view the Admin Dashboard.

> **Note:** This is a demo version of the application, and we have created a much better and deployed version using MERN Stack with integrated GenAI features.
